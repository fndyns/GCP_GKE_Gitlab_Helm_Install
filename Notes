Hello Ahmed. Happy Ramadan ! I see cyberneticlabs.io is not registered on AWS. Could you please add its CNAMEs to domain panel to be able to verify this domain in AWS SES service (edited)

We also need to use production access instead of Sandbox for AWS SES service as emails wont send properly in Sandbox mode. I clicked "Request Production Access" button here to request access from AWS. What can we type here in "Use Case " part ? Because if we type it short, AWS will reject our request. Please help on this (edited) 

**** After installing Gitlab via helm command, some pods like Gitlab sidekid, toolbox, webservice were stuck in InÄ±t status. To fix this, I needed to enable Psotgres Access from GKE. For that I put both Google Cloud SQL and GKE cluser in the same default VPC so that they would access each other via Private IP without need to use Public IP
