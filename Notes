Hello Ahmed. Happy Ramadan ! I see cyberneticlabs.io is not registered on AWS. Could you please add its CNAMEs to domain panel to be able to verify this domain in AWS SES service (edited)

We also need to use production access instead of Sandbox for AWS SES service as emails wont send properly in Sandbox mode. I clicked "Request Production Access" button here to request access from AWS. What can we type here in "Use Case " part ? Because if we type it short, AWS will reject our request. Please help on this (edited) 

**** After installing Gitlab via helm command, some pods like Gitlab sidekid, toolbox, webservice were stuck in InÄ±t status. To fix this, I needed to enable Psotgres Access from GKE. For that I put both Google Cloud SQL and GKE cluser in the same default VPC so that they would access each other via Private IP without need to use Public IP.
**** I have gotten many SMTP errors regarding authentication issues etc. Because of that I have checked username and passowrd many times. Please be aware that SMTP username should be as user_name: AKIAWA3RKI66ON4PZEEP . Please dont encode64 this username. Just paste it from the given one by AWS. For password part, please also dont encode64 , just directly paste the password from AWS to the secret generation command "kubectl create secret generic gitlab8-smtp-secret --from-literal=password=BGpW8Ry3Oop/C65pBBLwhuUyalTRpcsb0MOLk7JvpWzL". I also setted authentication: "plain" instead of authentication: "login"
